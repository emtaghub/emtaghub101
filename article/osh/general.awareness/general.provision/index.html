  <h1 id="rule.1000">Understanding the General Provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHS)</h1>

    <h2>Purpose & Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this Standard is to protect every worker from injury, sickness, or death by ensuring safe and healthful working conditions. It supports the conservation of manpower resources and the prevention of loss or damage to life and property.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Standard applies to all workplaces and forms of employment, except where specific exemptions apply. It covers industrial, commercial, agricultural, and service establishments.
    </p>

    <h2>1002 Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Employer:</strong> Any person or entity acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.</li>
      <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Any person hired, permitted, or suffered to work by an employer.</li>
      <li><strong>Industrial Enterprise:</strong> Any workplace, permanent or temporary where persons are employed in manufacturing, processing, or related work.</li>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong> A sound condition of body and mind enabling a worker to perform his or her job effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Working conditions that comply with established safety standards and do not expose workers to unnecessary risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Work Accident:</strong> Any unplanned or unexpected occurrence arising out of employment that may cause injury or damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Occupational Illness:</strong> Any disease caused by environmental or process-related factors peculiar to a specific occupation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1003 Administration & Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      1. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is responsible for administering and enforcing the OSHS. Employers must provide authorized representatives access to premises and records for inspection.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> DOLE inspectors check if a warehouse’s fire extinguishers are functional and accessible.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A manufacturing plant allows DOLE officers to review safety training logs.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A hotel cooperates with labor inspectors by presenting its latest risk assessment report.</p>

    <p>
      2. Every establishment must undergo inspection at least once a year. Special inspections may be conducted when serious hazards or complaints arise.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A construction site is inspected after a scaffolding incident to check compliance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A chemical factory is revisited to verify hazard corrections.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A small printing shop receives an annual inspection focusing on ventilation and lighting.</p>

    <h2>1004 Special Inspection, Investigation & Review</h2>
    <p>
      1. Any worker or representative who believes that a safety or health violation exists may request an inspection. Once verified, DOLE must conduct a special inspection immediately.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A nurse requests inspection after repeated needle-stick injuries occur.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Workers in a foundry report extreme heat exposure without ventilation.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A janitorial staff files a complaint about exposure to strong cleaning chemicals.</p>

    <p>
      2. The requesting worker must be informed in writing of the results of the inspection or investigation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A hospital worker receives a letter confirming safety violations and required corrective measures.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A construction crew is notified that no imminent danger was found after inspection.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A factory union receives a written summary of findings on machine guarding compliance.</p>

    <h2>1005 Duties of Employers, Workers & Other Persons</h2>


    <h3>Employer Duties</h3>

    <p>
      1. Employers must provide a workplace free from hazards that can cause death or serious physical harm. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A construction firm installs proper guardrails and signage in elevated areas.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A garment factory installs exhaust fans to reduce heat stress.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A logistics company sets speed limits for forklifts inside warehouses.</p>

    <p>
      2. Employers must provide complete safety instructions to all workers, particularly those new to the job, including emergency procedures and hazard awareness.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A new welder receives hands-on training on fire prevention and equipment shutdown.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A newly hired cleaner is oriented on safe chemical handling and storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> An IT office conducts orientation on electrical safety for new staff members.</p>

    <p>
      3. Employers must comply with all requirements of the OSHS and ensure that all equipment and practices meet prescribed standards.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A bakery installs approved fire-rated ovens following DOLE certification.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A power plant follows DOLE standards for lock-out/tag-out procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A restaurant complies with proper storage of LPG tanks and kitchen ventilation.</p>

    <p>
      4. Employers must use only approved safety devices and equipment and maintain them in good working condition.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A laboratory provides certified eye-wash stations and maintains regular testing.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A metal shop replaces worn-out gloves with new heat-resistant ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A mining company uses helmets that meet Philippine and international standards.</p>

    <p>
      5. Employers are required to maintain records of accidents, injuries, illnesses, and periodic inspections.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A construction firm logs all incidents and near-misses for review.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A manufacturing plant keeps electronic records of safety trainings and inspection results.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A service company prepares quarterly OSH compliance reports for submission to DOLE.</p>

<h3>Employee Duties</h3>

    <p>
      1. Employees must cooperate with their employers in implementing the OSHS and maintaining safe work practices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Machine operators assist in implementing lock-out/tag-out procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Workers voluntarily join the safety committee and promote safe practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Office employees support fire drills and evacuation exercises.</p>

    <p>
      2. Workers must report hazards or unsafe conditions to their supervisors promptly to prevent accidents.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A technician reports a leaking gas pipe immediately to maintenance staff.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A clerk informs HR about a flickering light that could cause eye strain.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A driver reports worn vehicle brakes before an accident occurs.</p>

    <p>
      3. Employees must use all safety devices and personal protective equipment provided by the employer.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A laboratory analyst wears gloves and goggles when handling chemicals.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A construction worker always wears a helmet and harness at height.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A janitor uses rubber gloves and a mask when cleaning restrooms.</p>

    <p>
      5. Employees are required to follow all safety instructions and procedures given by the employer.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A machine operator follows shutdown procedures before maintenance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A cook adheres to hygiene and temperature control policies in the kitchen.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A warehouse worker uses designated walkways to avoid forklift zones.</p>

    <p>
      6. Workers should actively participate in safety trainings and drills to improve awareness and emergency preparedness.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Employees join a first-aid training session organized by the company nurse.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A team participates in a fire-evacuation simulation.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Workers attend an earthquake preparedness seminar conducted by DOLE-BWC.</p>

    <h2>1006 Confidentiality of Trade Secrets</h2>
    <p>
      1. All information obtained during an inspection that may reveal trade secrets must be treated as confidential. Disclosure is allowed only when required in legal proceedings.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A DOLE inspector keeps proprietary software details confidential during an IT company inspection.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A food company’s secret recipe is not published in inspection reports.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Inspection data containing chemical formulas are securely stored and not shared publicly.</p>
